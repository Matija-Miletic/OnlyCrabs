        In our quest for knowledge, we have flown too close to the sun, to our
        horror we have learned that each planet is not a mere ball of rock or
        gas, but a writhing mass of crabs, entities that have scuttled across
        the sands of time since before the very stars were kindled.
      </p>
      <p>
        Cast aside your mundane metrics of miles or kilometers and prepare to
        comprehend the celestial spheres through the only meaningful measure:
        that of Crabs. Measure each planets girth not in earthly units but in
        the currency of the cosmos, crabs upon crabs, stretching into the dark
        infinity of space.
      </p>
      <p>
        Prepare to gaze upon a universe unshelled! and pray that your sanity
        survives the exposure.
